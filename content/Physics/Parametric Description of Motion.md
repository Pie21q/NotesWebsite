What forces are present in the scene
- Weight, always perpendicular to the ground
- Drag, always negative in relation to the motion of the ball, only active when the object is moving
- 'Cannon Force', which initially accelerates the ball
- Static frictional force, between the ball and the cannon walls
$$Acceleration: \frac{dv(t)}{dt}$$
Kinematic Laws
$z(t) = z(t_0) + v_{z0}(t-t_0) + \frac{a_z}{2}(t-t_0)^2 \rightsquigarrow s = \frac{1}{2}at^2$   
$v_z(t) = v_{z0} + a_z(t -t_0) \rightsquigarrow v=at$  

with reaction force we refer to a force which acts in opposite way due to another force `normal forces`
