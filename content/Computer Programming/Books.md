# History of Computing Machines

### Pascaline
- Digital, Non programmable machine based on gears
- Able to do simple operations like Addition and Subtraction
- Computations based on the discrete positions of the gears

### Differential Engine
- Digital, non programmable machine based on an Engine `who would have guessed`
- Able to compute polynomial approximations through the compute of tables
- Evolved into the Analytical Engine, which was General purpose programmable

### Z1
- Digital, Partially programmable machine
- Able to compute the 4 basic operations (`division was doing trough looping)
- Later evolved into the Z3
### TR-48
- Analog, programmable computer based on transistors
- Used for simulation and process control
- Faster than Digital solutions of its time

# Von Neumann architecture
Most current computers are built on this
Programs and data are stored as numbers in memory

#### Hardware
- Firmware: Small programs used to regulate how different components behave
#### Operating System
- Kernel
- Shell
