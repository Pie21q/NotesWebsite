Type of language without the nuances (you write exactly whatever you mean , every sentence has 1 meaning)
we will use logic to manipulate knowledge, associating expressions with their meaning

Reasoning needs ==guarantees

`After reading the party examples from the slides (example of a constraint satisfaction problem)`
We couldn't respond to the question "Who's invited as there isn't a single viable answer", however we can say for sure that the party is possible 

"Is George invited?"
The question is an =="Open World Assumption"==, we have no idea about the existence of George, but him not being present in the constraints doesn't necessarily mean he wasn't invited

Reasoning is done trough symbolic manipulation, where the actual real world meaning of the symbol has no meaning

Different languages are created to deal with different problems, using a big "unified" language is more complicated and less time-efficient
