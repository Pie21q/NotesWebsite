# Intelligence 
AI deals with machines showing intelligent traits, isn't equivalent to humane cognitive attributes
Humans work on 2 different thought processes; ==system 1 (reflexes, fast and intuitive) and system 2 (Used in thought, slow and more logical, takes effort and time)

System 1 is useful for simple task but can be easily fooled (Pareidolia) it's also hard wired and hard to modify it (In AI creation and modification of it can be very expensive as it needs time and repetition to build a strong muscle memory)

System 1 applied to AI is called Machine Learning

# Machine Learning
very useful but presents some limitations
- Lack of interpretability
- Hallucinations (will always try to produce an answer, even if its wrong `eg. asking for an image of an animal could produce one of a plant)
- Static (difficult to change)
- Deep learning models produce an opinion based on data without having actual "Knowledge" `different models may also produce different opinions
- No double checking / refining of either input or output

# Symbolic AI
System 2 applied to AI
==Manipulation of symbols to extract consequences and produce decisions==
Symbolic AI actually performs Reasoning by making deductions from previously known facts `eg. if all capitals are inside their own country, Rome being the capital of italy means it's located inside Italy`
Works trough guarantees, so answers are certain (No "Hallucinations")

This presents some advantages
- Interpretability (Is able to explain the given answer)
- Correctness is guaranteed
- Updates are easy and inexpensive by changing the known facts
	- flexibility
	- modularity
- "Humbleness" (Admits when it isn't able to answer a question)
- no ambiguity
The course will focus on Symbolic AI
`Research is being done about utilizing both system at once (Neuro-Symbolic systems`
