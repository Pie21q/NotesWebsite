Bounded and unbounded Sets
$Q \supseteq A \rightarrow where \ A \{2,3\}, if \ exists \ a \ number \ such \ that \ 2<r \in Q <3, then \ A \ is \ a \ bounded  \ set$
Q couldn't be a bounded set as  $Q = \{-\infty, +\infty\}$

A Set can be bounded below, such that  $A = \{0, +\infty \}$, A Set can also be upwards bounded, such that$A = \{-\infty, 2 \}$
